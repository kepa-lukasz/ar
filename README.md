this is my first project with AR.js and face recognition in javascript
# AR
AR (augmented reality) the real-time use of information in the form of text, graphics, audio and other virtual enhancements integrated with real-world objects

*its sth similar to apple vision*

# face recognition
tbh i think it will be simple entry to ai world.
